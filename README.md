# Waypoint Editor (Package)

The Waypoint Editor provides a system to create, manage, add functionality to waypoints that allow AI agents to follow and perform unique actions upon reaching destinations. This is not intended to replace existing pathfinding solutions but instead compliment them and allow for new mechanics.

## Prerequisites
The current version of the Waypoint Editor requires at minimum Unity 2021.3 LTS and should work with future releases.
